# Valtio

### Proxy state made simple.

The Valtio api is minimal, flexible, unopinionated and a touch magical. Valtio's proxy turns the object you pass it into a self-aware proxy, allowing fine-grained subscription and creativity in making state updates. In React, Valtio shines at render optimization. It is compatible with Suspense and React 18. Valtio is also a viable option in vanilla javascript applications.

#### Installation

```bash
npm i valtio
```
