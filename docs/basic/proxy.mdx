# proxy

The proxy tracks changes to the original object and all nested objects, notifying listeners when a new version of the object is created.

```jsx
import { proxy, useSnapshot } from 'valtio'

const state = proxy({ count: 0, text: 'hello' })
```

#### Mutate from anywhere

You can make changes to it in the same way you would to a normal js-object.

```jsx
setInterval(() => {
  ++state.count
}, 1000)
```

#### Optimizations

Noop

Updates that set the value of a property to the same value are ignored. Subscribers will not be informed of a version change.

```jsx
const state = proxy({ count: 0 })

state.count = 0 // has no effect
```

Batching

Multiple changes in the same event loop tick to will be batched together. Subscribers will be notified of a single version change.

```jsx
const state = proxy({ count: 0, text: 'hello' })
// subscribers will be notified once after both mutations
state.count = 1
state.text = 'world'
```

#### Nested proxies

Proxies and be nested in other proxy objects and updated as a whole.

```jsx
import { proxy, useSnapshot } from 'valtio'

const personState = proxy({ name: 'Timo', role: "admin" })
const authState = proxy({ status: "loggedIn", user: personState })

authState.user.name = 'Nina'
```

#### Gotchas

You cannot descructure the object from proxy and subscribe to a property.

```jsx
// don't
const { user } = proxy({ user: { name: 'Timo' } })
subscibe(user, () => {...})

// do
const state = proxy({ user: { name: 'Nina' } })
subscibe(state.user, () => {...})
```

Not everything can be proxied. Generally, you are safe if it is serializable. Classes can also be proxied. But avoid special objects. 

```jsx
  // these won't work - changes to these objects causes updates
  const state = proxy({
    chart: d3.select('#chart'),
    component: React.createElement('div'),
    map: new Map(), // see proxyMap
    storage: localStorage
  })

  // this will work
  class User {
    first = null
    last = null
    constructor(first, last) {
      this.first = first
      this.last = last
    }
    greet() {
      return `Hi ${this.first}!`
    }
    get fullName() {
      return `${this.first} ${this.last}`
    }
  }
  const state = proxy(new User('Timo', 'Kivinen'))
```
